* Group project for Week 6 at Makers.

* Our group consisted of Emil Iliev, Emily Chai, Euge Guerrero and Kate Gleeson.

* Air BnB style website built using Sinatra.

* Users can list properties, or request to book a property.

* We're particularly proud of the calendar that only allows users to select dates that haven't been booked yet!

* You can visit the website <a href="https://eeekbnb.herokuapp.com">here</a>.

* To be improved:  
Due to time constraints styling remains incomplete.  But we're very pleased with the backend logic!
